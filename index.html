       For those of you that do not know who I am, my name is Brandon Ruggles, and I am a third-year computer science major at NJIT. I will be using this page as a virtual portfolio for my most significant programming projects and contributions. Please be aware that This is NOT a complete listing of every programming project I have worked on, but rather a showcase of the projects that I believe are the most significant. This web page excludes any programming assignments that I completed while at NJIT. You can browse through my posted projects or contact me using the links above. You can also view my resume by clicking the button below (this requires a PDF plugin for your browser). I put this web page together myself using  Bootstrap, HTML5, Javascript, and CSS.

The final level is nearly impossible to beat due to a bug I never went back to fix. I plan to recreate this game in the future using C++. In the game, the WASD keys are used to move, and the spacebar is used to interact with levers. To use your telekinetic powers in-game, hold shift and use the WASD keys to move the crosshair over a moveable (brown) block. After doing so, holding space will grip the object, and releasing space will let the object go.",true,true);
